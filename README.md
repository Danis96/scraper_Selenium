# AI Web Scraper with Selenium and Ollama

A powerful web scraping tool that combines Selenium for robust web scraping with AI-powered content parsing using Ollama. This project provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for scraping websites and extracting specific information using natural language instructions.

## Features

- üîç **Advanced Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium with anti-detection measures
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Parsing**: Leverages Ollama for intelligent content extraction
- üéØ **Natural Language Queries**: Describe what you want to extract in plain English
- üßπ **Smart Content Cleaning**: Removes scripts, styles, and unnecessary whitespace
- üì± **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver (included in the project)
- Ollama installed and running locally

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd scraper_Selenium
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
